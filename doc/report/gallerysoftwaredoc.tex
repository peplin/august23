\section{Gallery Software Setup}
To replicate the gallery installation, the following systems \& equipment are required:

\paragraph{Server}
\begin{itemize}
\item MySQL server
\item Web server, root pointing to $<$location of august package$>$/www
\item Ports 80 \& 8080 open
\item Java JRE 1.5 or greater
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Multitouch or Desktop Client}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multitouch table
\item Hardware accelerated graphics
\item Network connection to server (can be over Internet)
\item Sound output (ideally to a radio headset)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Wiremap Client}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wiremap
\item Projector
\item Sound output (ideally to a sound dome)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create an "august" user for the MySQL database
\item Initialize the august database using the SQL script found at \texttt{/august/database/create.sql}
\item Run the compiled Twoverse server to check the database connection and create the XML feed file: \texttt{java -jar twoverse\_server.jar}
\item Create a symbolic link to the feed.xml file that was just created in the web server's root directory (this should be /august/www/)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Multitouch or Desktop Client Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plug the radio headset into the audio output of the computer (if you are using a radio)
\item Open the client sketch (either Multitouch or Desktop version) and modify the configuration parameter for the server IP to point to the correct address.
\item Configure the Wiremap server IP configuration parameter in the CreateMode.pde file to point to the address of the Wiremap client (if you are using one)
\item Run the sketch in Processing, or export a compiled application to simplify restarting the application
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Wiremap Client Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Plug the sound dome into the audio output of the computer (if you are using a sound dome)
\item Open the client sketch and modify the configuration parameter for the Multitouch Client IP to point to the correct address of the Multitouch Client (not the Twoverse server)
\item Run the sketch in Processing, or export a compiled application to simplify restarting the application
\end{enumerate}


The Multitouch or Desktop client connects to the Twoverse server and manages the creation and storing of new stars. The Wiremap client receives a message from the Multitouch Client when a new star is being created, which initializes the sound and visuals for the star formation experience. See the Twoverse library documentation for more detailed information on this relationship.
