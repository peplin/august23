\section{Wiremap}
The Wiremap is an innovative projection technique that builds a real and interactive 3d image by manipulating light from a projector.  The projector throws its beam on an array of vertical wires (the number of wires depends on your desired resolution). From the focal point of the projector’s lense, all the wires are evenly spaced from one another. However, due to the randomized dimension of depth, from any other perspective, the wires create a 3‐D map of cyberspace. The result is a projection screen that allows for the visualization of a 2‐D image into a 3‐D object whose source is the light  of a projector. An object can move around and change in color or size according to whatever is delegated by the programmer in Processing.   

Our specific map was made using mason’s string, 3⁄4 inch plywood and some hardware for the weighting down each string and for hanging the entire wiremap in space. Our map used 256 strings that are placed in a randomized dimension of depth through 256 holes on both upper and lower alignment boards. These strings are secured through the alignment boards at the top and bottom with hardware, with the bottom hardware also providing an element of weight to each individual string to keep it taught. A calibration stage must be done after initial setup of the wiremap, this process aligns the top and bottom boards so that they are parallel with one another. Also, the focal point of the projector must be properly placed in line with the wiremap so that each of the 256 strings contains only one pixel width on its projection surface.

\subsection{Wiremap Software Library}
In order to facilitate quicker prototyping and make the Wiremap software more accessible to the team, we wrote a simple Processing library for rendering certain shapes in the Wiremap field. The library replaces the source code provided by the creator of the Wiremap \cite{AH} by reducing code duplication and abstracting most of the implementation details away from a user who wishes to simply draw a sphere, rectangle or sliver in the field.

\paragraph{Abstraction}
The Wiremap library gathers the coordinate conversion and wire selection math into a single class. The previous method required duplicating a set of functions in every Processing sketch that output to the Wiremap. Now, the user creates an instance of the Wiremap class and provides a few key measurements of the physical interface as well as a text file listing the wire depths. The calculation is done as necessary, and not exposed to the user.

\paragraph{Coordinate Systems}
One key difference between the original source and the Wiremap library is the coordinate system used for each plane. Previously, the coordinates of X, Y and Z were all physical inches and matched the actual dimensions of the Wiremap. To facilitate quicker transitioning from a regular Processing sketch (using the standard 2D renderer) to one for the Wiremap, the X and Y were changed to be in the standard, Processing-style pixel coordinate system.

The Z plane remains in inches, as thre is no obvious relationship between Z space on the screen (which is infinite in both directions) and Z space in the Wiremap field (limited by the physical dimensions). Thus, Z coordinates in the field range from 0 to the field depth.

\paragraph{}The library has been released under the Apache open source license, and will continue to evolve after this project's completion. See the library's documentation for details on installation and usage \cite{CP}.
