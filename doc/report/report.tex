\begin{abstract}\centering
August 23, 1966 is a project from the University of Michigan, supported by a
grant from the GROCS (Grant Opportunities Collaborative Spaces) program in 2009.
This report serves as documentation of the activities of the project over the
course of the semester, as well as a guide for future groups to use or learn
from the hardware and software created.
