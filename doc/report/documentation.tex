\chapter{Hardware/Software Documentation}
This chapter describes the individual hardware and software systems built by the group. Some systems were directed at use in the gallery system, so the documentation is somewhat specific. In other cases, the system is easily generalized and the documentation reflects that. All of the source code and documentation for software usage can be found in the included software package \cite{PACK}.
