Wiremap Code - 

Thank you for your interest in the code behind the Wiremap.  It's always exciting to meet new people and to encounter new ideas.  I hope my code is clean enough to facilitate that, and that the project is interesting enough as well.

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at hwang.al [at] gmail [dot] com.  That's also where to email me if you'd like me to test any code you're running if the hardware is available.
